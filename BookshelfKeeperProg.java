/**
 * Class BookshelfKeeperProg 
 *
 * PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
 * The Bookshelf-keeper program that maintains a bookshelf in non-decreasing order by height, that enables users to perform a series of put & pick operations via a BookshelfKeeper object. 
 * The pick operation refers to a case where you need to pick a book from a given position (index), and the put operation refers to putting a book of given height on the shelf. 
 * Books can be added (put) or removed (pick) from the bookshelf only from either of the two ends and it is required to perform this using minimum number of calls to its mutator functions. 
 * The bookshelf is always maintained in a sorted order after completing any operation. 
 *
 *
 * The program consists of the following:
 *
 * 1) Bookshelf:
 * The class Bookshelf implements idea of arranging books into a bookshelf. 
 * Books on a bookshelf can only be accessed in a specific way so books donâ€™t fall down. 
 * Books can be added or removed from only one of the ends of the shelf. They can be accessed by specifying their location. 
 * Books are identified only by their height; 2 books of the same height can be considered as 2 copies of the same book.
 *
 * 
 * 2) BookshelfKeeper:
 * The class BookshelfKeeper maintains a bookshelf with books that are kept in a sorted state of non-decreasing order of heights. 
 * Enables users to perform efficient putPos or pickHeight operation on a bookshelf of books kept in non-decreasing order by height. 
 * Restriction: single books can only be added or removed from one of the two *ends* of the bookshelf to complete a higher level pick or put operation.  
 * Pick or put operations are performed with a minimum number of such adds or removes.
 *
 *
 * 3) BookshelfKeeperProg:
 * The class BookshelfKeeperProg main method takes user input of a list of integers and ensures that all the books on the bookshelf are positive and in non-decreasing order.
 * It enables the user to perform a series of pickPos and putHeight operations on the bookshelf with user commands "pick" and "put".  
 *
 *
 * SUMMARY:
 * The BookshelfKeeperProg takes user input and creates an initial bookshelf. The Bookshelf has the interface for arranging the books on the bookshelf and its mutator functions. The BookshelfKeeper ensures the sorted state of the bookshelf and the validity of the mutator functions on the bookshelf. 
 *
 * 
 * RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
 * To observe the implementation of the BookshelfKeeper, compile and run as follows: 
 * javac Bookshelf*.java
 * java -ea BookshelfKeeperProg
 *
 *
 * CLASS DESCRIPTION: 
 * Class BookshelfKeeperProg's main method takes user input of a list of integers that make-up the initial arrangement of the bookshelf. 
 * It ensures that all the books on the bookshelf are positive and in non-decreasing order.
 * Once the initial configuration is read the only commands allowed are pick, put, and end.
 * It enables the user to perform a series of pickPos and putHeight operations on a BookshelfKeeper object in an interactive mode with user commands "pick" and "put".  
 * For put operation, the height given must be positive.
 * For pick operation, the position given must be within the valid bounds for the bookshelf. 
 * The user can then submit the user command "end", once all the required operations have been completed. 
 *
